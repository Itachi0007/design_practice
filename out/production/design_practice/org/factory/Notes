Problem-
We need to create a Computer class where we have objects of Computers like PC, server, laptops etc.

Introducing a factory between super and sub class helps to reduce the coupling between them.

In case I make changes to PC class then my Driver need not be modified,
but if I make a new computer type - Server, my Factory inside Driver will still support it.

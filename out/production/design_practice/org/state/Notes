We are working with the state pattern now.

Build a canvas where we can use different tools like a Brush, Eraser etc..

Q. Which OOP principle fits best here?
A. (*oly*orphis*)

Q. Why is that solution wrong?
A. If we add new tools like Circles or Fill then we need to add more IF/SWITCH statements
   and modify the existing class

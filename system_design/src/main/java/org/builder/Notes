The Person class should focus on what it represents (a person, with properties like name, email, etc.),
while the PersonBuilder class focuses on how to construct a Person object, with optional parameters and method chaining

Q. Why my solution was bad?
A. In the Builder Pattern, it’s a good practice to create a separate Builder class or an inner static class
that constructs the Person object. Currently, you’re modifying the Person object itself inside the builder methods,
which is not ideal as it couples the construction process with the product itself.
Separating the builder keeps the object immutable and provides cleaner separation of concerns.
